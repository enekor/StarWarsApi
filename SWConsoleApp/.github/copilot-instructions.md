This project is a C# console application that interacts with a StarWarsApi REST backend. Use HttpClient and Newtonsoft.Json for all HTTP and JSON operations. The main workflow is to fetch films, display them, allow selection, show details, and POST to save films. All API endpoints are under /Film/.
